# What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is a free, open source high availability solution, providing load balancing and proxying for TCP and HTTP-based applications by spreading requests across multiple servers. It is written in C and has a reputation for being fast and efficient (in terms of processor and memory usage).

# How to use this image

Since no two users of HAProxy are likely to configure it exactly alike, this image does not come with any default configuration.

Please refer to [upstream's excellent (and comprehensive) documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/) on the subject of configuring HAProxy for your needs.

It is also worth checking out the [`examples/` directory from upstream](http://git.haproxy.org/?p=haproxy-1.8.git;a=tree;f=examples).

## Create a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM arm32v5/haproxy:1.7
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Build the container

```console
$ docker build -t my-haproxy .
```

## Test the configuration file

```console
$ docker run -it --rm --name haproxy-syntax-check my-haproxy haproxy -c -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Run the container

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy my-haproxy
```

You may need to publish the ports your HAProxy is listening on to the host by specifying the -p option, for example -p 8080:80 to publish port 8080 from the container host to port 80 in the container. Make sure the port you're using is free.

## Directly via bind mount

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy -v /path/to/etc/haproxy:/usr/local/etc/haproxy:ro arm32v5/haproxy:1.7
```

Note that your host's `/path/to/etc/haproxy` folder should be populated with a file named `haproxy.cfg`. If this configuration file refers to any other files within that folder then you should ensure that they also exist (e.g. template files such as `400.http`, `404.http`, and so forth). However, many minimal configurations do not require any supporting files.

### Reloading config

If you used a bind mount for the config and have edited your `haproxy.cfg` file, you can use HAProxy's graceful reload feature by sending a `SIGHUP` to the container:

```console
$ docker kill -s HUP my-running-haproxy
```

The entrypoint script in the image checks for running the command `haproxy` and replaces it with `haproxy-systemd-wrapper` from HAProxy upstream which takes care of signal handling to do the graceful reload. Under the hood this uses the `-sf` option of `haproxy` so "there are two small windows of a few milliseconds each where it is possible that a few connection failures will be noticed during high loads" (see [Stopping and restarting HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/download/1.7/doc/management.txt)).
